#Hamming Distance Based Brute-Force Bitcoin Key Search
This project is a Python script designed to find Bitcoin addresses that are close to a target address in terms of Hamming distance. It performs a brute-force search within a specified range of private keys, identifying those that generate addresses within a certain Hamming distance from the target address.

#Features
Brute-Force Search: The script systematically searches for Bitcoin addresses by iterating through a specified range of private keys.
Hamming Distance Calculation: It calculates the Hamming distance between generated Bitcoin addresses and a target address, identifying those that are close.
Customizable: The search range and target Hamming distance can be customized.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python standard libraries are used:

hashlib
binascii
random
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
#Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hamming-bitcoin-key-search.git
cd hamming-bitcoin-key-search
Install required libraries:

The script uses standard Python libraries, so no additional packages are required.

#Usage
Set the Target Address and Hamming Distance:

Inside the script, you can modify the target_address and target_hamming_distance variables to your specific needs.

python
Kodu kopyala
target_address = "13zb1hQbWVsc2S7ZTZnP2G4undNNpdh5so"
target_hamming_distance = 50  # Desired Hamming distance
Run the Script:

Run the script with Python:

bash
Kodu kopyala
python hamming_bitcoin_search.py
View Results:

The script will output the private key, corresponding Bitcoin address, and the Hamming distance if a match is found. If no match is found within the specified range, it will indicate that no suitable private key was found.

#Customization
Search Range: Modify the start_range and end_range variables to set the range of private keys you wish to search.

python
Kodu kopyala
start_range = 0x2d0ffffffffffffff
end_range = 0x2dfffffffffffffff
Hamming Distance Threshold: Adjust the target_hamming_distance to change the threshold for identifying close addresses.
